    "I have tried to figure out how to use pde for over 12h (over multiple days by the way) but I don't know how to do time derivatives with second order stuff and have asked multiple AIs and my groupmate for help and we can't figure it out. Furthermore, it looks like Nick wasn't available for a significant period of time before this as well and I've been trying my hardest to get this all to run but it's just been a disaster. \n",
    "By the way, we are trying to implement equation 7.42 and 7.46. But the higher-order derivatives have us completely stuck. We are aware that the initial condition must be a perturbation and in 7.42 we assume a flat surface, but we can add a vertical velocity as initial condition at z=0 when considering terrain (for 7.46). Height is 20km, width is 200km. We plan to eventually plot the wave going across the screen. "
